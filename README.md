# ðŸ“Š GitHub Stats:

  I created a static website using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. This project involved building a responsive, clean, and modern-looking site that performs well across various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. Tailwind CSS allowed for rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS, thanks to its extensive utility classes.

  #
 
  The website follows best design practices, ensuring consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes. Accessibility was a key consideration, adhering to web standards to make the site usable for people with disabilities. The static nature of the website contributes to fast load times and improved performance, enhancing both user experience and SEO.

Technologies used in this project include HTML for structuring web pages and Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
